# **Heat Exchanger Tube Length Calculator**

This Jupyter Notebook was generated by chatCPT under supervision of Isak Jonsson. It calculates the required tube length for a ground-coupled heat exchanger based on user-defined parameters such as tube diameter, air velocity, and target heat exchanger effectiveness. The calculations assume estimated values for material properties and environmental conditions.

### **Inputs You Can Change**
- **`T_inlet` (Inlet Air Temperature):** The temperature of air entering the heat exchanger tube (in Â°C).
- **`v` (Tube Velocity):** The velocity of air moving through the tube (in m/s).
- **`target_effectiveness`:** The desired effectiveness of the heat exchanger (between 0 and 1).

### **Assumptions**
1. **Material Properties:**
   - Tube thermal conductivity, air thermal conductivity, and soil thermal conductivity are estimated based on typical values.
   - Adjustments may be necessary for specific materials or environments.

2. **Environmental Conditions:**
   - Ground temperature is considered stable and uniform at the specified depth.
   - Air properties such as density, viscosity, and specific heat capacity are based on standard atmospheric conditions.

3. **Flow Conditions:**
   - The program determines whether the airflow is turbulent or laminar based on the Reynolds number.

### **How to Use**
1. Modify the input values in the Python cell labeled "Inputs".
2. Run the code cell to calculate:
   - Required tube length
   - Mass flow rate
   - Heat transfer properties
3. Review the outputs to understand the system's performance.
