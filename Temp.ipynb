# **Heat Exchanger Tube Length Calculator**

This Jupyter Notebook was generated by chatCPT under supervision of Isak Jonsson. It calculates the required tube length for a ground-coupled heat exchanger based on user-defined parameters such as tube diameter, air velocity, and target heat exchanger effectiveness. The calculations assume estimated values for material properties and environmental conditions.

### **Inputs You Can Change**
- **`T_inlet` (Inlet Air Temperature):** The temperature of air entering the heat exchanger tube (in °C).
- **`v` (Tube Velocity):** The velocity of air moving through the tube (in m/s).
- **`target_effectiveness`:** The desired effectiveness of the heat exchanger (between 0 and 1).

---

### **Assumptions**
1. **Material Properties:**
   - Tube thermal conductivity, air thermal conductivity, and soil thermal conductivity are estimated based on typical values.
   - Adjustments may be necessary for specific materials or environments.

2. **Environmental Conditions:**
   - Ground temperature is considered stable and uniform at the specified depth.
   - Air properties such as density, viscosity, and specific heat capacity are based on standard atmospheric conditions.

3. **Flow Conditions:**
   - The program determines whether the airflow is turbulent or laminar based on the Reynolds number.

### **How to Use**
1. Modify the input values in the Python cell labeled "Inputs".
2. Run the code cell to calculate:
   - Required tube length
   - Mass flow rate
   - Heat transfer properties
3. Review the outputs to understand the system's performance.



# Heat Exchanger Tube Length Calculator
# This program calculates the required tube length for a ground-coupled heat exchanger
# based on given parameters like airflow, tube diameter, and heat exchanger effectiveness.

import numpy as np

# Inputs: User can modify these parameters
D = 0.11  # Tube diameter (m)
v = 3  # Air velocity in the tube (m/s)
rho_air = 1.2  # Air density (kg/m³)
cp_air = 1005  # Specific heat capacity of air (J/(kg·K))
k_air = 0.025  # Thermal conductivity of air (W/(m·K))
mu_air = 1.81e-5  # Dynamic viscosity of air (kg/(m·s))
Pr_air = 0.7  # Prandtl number (dimensionless)
T_ground = 10  # Ground temperature (°C)
T_inlet = 20  # Air temperature entering the tube (°C)
target_effectiveness = 0.8  # Target heat exchanger effectiveness (0 to 1)

# Tube properties
t_tube = 0.003  # Tube wall thickness (m)
k_tube = 0.4  # Thermal conductivity of the tube material (W/(m·K))

# Soil properties
k_soil = 1.5  # Soil thermal conductivity (W/(m·K))

# Step 1: Calculate Reynolds Number to check if the flow is turbulent or laminar
Re = (rho_air * v * D) / mu_air  # Reynolds number
if Re > 2300:
    flow_type = "Turbulent"
    # Turbulent flow: Use Dittus-Boelter equation for Nusselt number
    Nu = 0.023 * (Re**0.8) * (Pr_air**0.3)
else:
    flow_type = "Laminar"
    # Laminar flow: Use Nusselt number for fully developed laminar flow in a circular tube
    Nu = 3.66  # Constant for fully developed laminar flow

# Step 2: Calculate the convective heat transfer coefficient inside the tube
h_conv = (Nu * k_air) / D  # Convective heat transfer coefficient (W/(m²·K))

# Step 3: Calculate thermal resistances
R_cond = t_tube / (k_tube * np.pi * D)  # Conduction resistance of the tube wall
R_soil = 1 / (2 * np.pi * k_soil)  # Approximate soil resistance for radial heat transfer

# Step 4: Calculate the overall heat transfer coefficient
U = 1 / (1/h_conv + R_cond + R_soil)  # Overall heat transfer coefficient (W/(m²·K))

# Step 5: Calculate maximum heat transfer
m_dot = rho_air * v * (np.pi * (D/2)**2)  # Mass flow rate of air (kg/s)
Q_max = m_dot * cp_air * (T_inlet - T_ground)  # Maximum heat transfer (W)
target_Q = target_effectiveness * Q_max  # Target heat transfer (W)

# Step 6: Calculate required tube length
delta_T = T_inlet - T_ground  # Temperature difference between air and ground (°C)
L_required = target_Q / (U * np.pi * D * delta_T)  # Required tube length (m)

# Outputs: Results for the user
