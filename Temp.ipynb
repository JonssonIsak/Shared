It calculates the required tube length for a ground-coupled heat exchanger based on user-defined parameters such as tube diameter, air velocity, and target heat exchanger effectiveness. The calculations assume estimated values for material properties and environmental conditions.\n\n---\n\n### **Inputs You Can Change**\n- **`T_inlet` (Inlet Air Temperature):** The temperature of air entering the heat exchanger tube (in °C).\n- **`v` (Tube Velocity):** The velocity of air moving through the tube (in m/s).\n- **`target_effectiveness`:** The desired effectiveness of the heat exchanger (between 0 and 1).\n\n---\n\n### **Assumptions**\n1. **Material Properties:**\n   - Tube thermal conductivity, air thermal conductivity, and soil thermal conductivity are estimated based on typical values.\n   - Adjustments may be necessary for specific materials or environments.\n\n2. **Environmental Conditions:**\n   - Ground temperature is considered stable and uniform at the specified depth.\n   - Air properties such as density, viscosity, and specific heat capacity are based on standard atmospheric conditions.\n\n3. **Flow Conditions:**\n   - The program determines whether the airflow is turbulent or laminar based on the Reynolds number.\n\n---\n\n### **How to Use**\n1. Modify the input values in the Python cell labeled \"Inputs\".\n2. Run the code cell to calculate:\n   - Required tube length\n   - Mass flow rate\n   - Heat transfer properties\n3. Review the outputs to understand the system's performance.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Heat Exchanger Tube Length Calculator\n# This program calculates the required tube length for a ground-coupled heat exchanger\n# based on given parameters like airflow, tube diameter, and heat exchanger effectiveness.\n\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Inputs: User can modify these parameters\nD = 0.11  # Tube diameter (m)\nv = 3  # Air velocity in the tube (m/s)\nrho_air = 1.2  # Air density (kg/m³)\ncp_air = 1005  # Specific heat capacity of air (J/(kg·K))\nk_air = 0.025  # Thermal conductivity of air (W/(m·K))\nmu_air = 1.81e-5  # Dynamic viscosity of air (kg/(m·s))\nPr_air = 0.7  # Prandtl number (dimensionless)\nT_ground = 10  # Ground temperature (C)\nT_inlet = 20  # Air temperature entering the tube (C)\ntarget_effectiveness = 0.8  # Target heat exchanger effectiveness (0 to 1)\n\n# Tube properties\nt_tube = 0.003  # Tube wall thickness (m)\nk_tube = 0.4  # Thermal conductivity of the tube material (W/(m·K))\n\n# Soil properties\nk_soil = 1.5  # Soil thermal conductivity (W/(m·K))\n\n# Step 1: Calculate Reynolds Number to check if the flow is turbulent or laminar\nRe = (rho_air * v * D) / mu_air  # Reynolds number\nif Re > 2300:\n    flow_type = \"Turbulent\"\n    # Turbulent flow: Use Dittus-Boelter equation for Nusselt number\n    Nu = 0.023 * (Re**0.8) * (Pr_air**0.3)\nelse:\n    flow_type = \"Laminar\"\n    # Laminar flow: Use Nusselt number for fully developed laminar flow in a circular tube\n    Nu = 3.66  # Constant for fully developed laminar flow\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the convective heat transfer coefficient inside the tube\nh_conv = (Nu * k_air) / D  # Convective heat transfer coefficient (W/(m²·K))\n\n# Step 3: Calculate thermal resistances\nR_cond = t_tube / (k_tube * np.pi * D)  # Conduction resistance of the tube wall\nR_soil = 1 / (2 * np.pi * k_soil)  # Approximate soil resistance for radial heat transfer\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the overall heat transfer coefficient\nU = 1 / (1/h_conv + R_cond + R_soil)  # Overall heat transfer coefficient (W/(m²·K))\n\n# Step 5: Calculate maximum heat transfer\nm_dot = rho_air * v * (np.pi * (D/2)**2)  # Mass flow rate of air (kg/s)\nQ_max = m_dot * cp_air * (T_inlet - T_ground)  # Maximum heat transfer (W)\ntarget_Q = target_effectiveness * Q_max  # Target heat transfer (W)\n\n# Step 6: Calculate required tube length\ndelta_T = T_inlet - T_ground  # Temperature difference between air and ground (°C)\nL_required = target_Q / (U * np.pi * D * delta_T)  # Required tube length (m)\n\n# Outputs: Results for the user\nprint(\"Heat Exchanger Tube Length Calculator\")\nprint(\"-\" * 40)\nprint(f\"Flow Type: {flow_type} (Reynolds Number: {Re:.2f})\")\nprint(f\"Nusselt Number: {Nu:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"Convective Heat Transfer Coefficient (h_conv): {h_conv:.2f} W/(m²·K)\")\nprint(f\"Overall Heat Transfer Coefficient (U): {U:.2f} W/(m²·K)\")\nprint(f\"Mass Flow Rate (m_dot): {m_dot:.4f} kg/s\")\nprint(f\"Maximum Heat Transfer (Q_max): {Q_max:.2f} W\")\nprint(f\"Target Heat Transfer (Q_target): {target_Q:.2f} W\")\nprint(f\"Required Tube Length: {L_required:.2f} m\")\n","metadata":{"trusted":false},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Heat Exchanger Tube Length Calculator\n----------------------------------------\nFlow Type: Turbulent (Reynolds Number: 21878.45)\nNusselt Number: 61.27\nConvective Heat Transfer Coefficient (h_conv): 13.93 W/(m²·K)\nOverall Heat Transfer Coefficient (U): 5.01 W/(m²·K)\nMass Flow Rate (m_dot): 0.0342 kg/s\nMaximum Heat Transfer (Q_max): 343.83 W\nTarget Heat Transfer (Q_target): 275.06 W\nRequired Tube Length: 15.89 m\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":1},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"trusted":false},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null}]}
